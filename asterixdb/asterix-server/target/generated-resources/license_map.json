Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR\nOTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS\nLICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.\n\nBY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE\nBOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED\nHERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.\n\n1. Definitions\n\n    \"Collective Work\" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or\n    encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along\n    with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent\n    works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that\n    constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as\n    defined below) for the purposes of this License.\n    \"Derivative Work\" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and\n    other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement,\n    dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording,\n    art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the\n    Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that\n    constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for\n    the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a\n    musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in\n    timed-relation with a moving image (\"synching\") will be considered a\n    Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.\n    \"Licensor\" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the\n    terms of this License.\n    \"Original Author\" means the individual or entity who created the Work.\n    \"Work\" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of\n    this License.\n    \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who\n    has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the\n    Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise\n    rights under this License despite a previous violation.\n\n2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or\nrestrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on\nthe exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other\napplicable laws.\n\n3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor\nhereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the\nduration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work\nas stated below:\n\n    to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective\n    Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;\n    to create and reproduce Derivative Works;\n    to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly,\n    and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work\n    including as incorporated in Collective Works;\n    to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly,\n    and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative\n    Works.\n\n    For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:\n        Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the\n        exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance\n        rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public\n        performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.\n        Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive\n        right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or\n        designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord\n        You create from the Work (\"cover version\") and distribute, subject to\n        the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright\n        Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).\n    Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n    the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to\n    collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g.\n    SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast)\n    of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114\n    of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).\n\nThe above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or\nhereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications\nas are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.\nAll rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n\n4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject\nto and limited by the following restrictions:\n\n    You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly\n    digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You\n    must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License\n    with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display,\n    publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose\n    any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or\n    the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not\n    sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this\n    License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute,\n    publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work\n    with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a\n    manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above\n    applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not\n    require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to\n    the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from\n    any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective\n    Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested. If You create a\n    Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent\n    practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by\n    clause 4(b), as requested.\n    If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally\n    perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep\n    intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the\n    medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or\n    pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author\n    and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor\n    institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution in Licensor's\n    copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of\n    such party or parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent\n    reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that\n    Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not\n    refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in\n    the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in\n    the Derivative Work (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original\n    Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). Such\n    credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that\n    in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such\n    credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and\n    in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship\n    credit.\n\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS\nTHE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING\nTHE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT\nLIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,\nOR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME\nJURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH\nEXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN\nNO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,\nINCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS\nLICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. Termination\n\n    This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically\n    upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities\n    who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this\n    License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such\n    individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.\n    Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\n    Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is\n    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).\n    Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work\n    under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;\n    provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this\n    License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted\n    under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full\n    force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n\n8. Miscellaneous\n\n    Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a\n    Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work\n    on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this\n    License.\n    Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work,\n    Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same\n    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n    If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under\n    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the\n    remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the\n    parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum\n    extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n    No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach\n    consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by\n    the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n    This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with\n    respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements\n    or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor\n    shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any\n    communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual\n    written agreement of the Licensor and You.",

ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS\nLICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.\n\nBY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE\nBOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED\nHERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.\n\n1. Definitions\n\n    \"Collective Work\" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or\n    encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along\n    with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent\n    works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that\n    constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as\n    defined below) for the purposes of this License.\n    \"Derivative Work\" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and\n    other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement,\n    dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording,\n    art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the\n    Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that\n    constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for\n    the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a\n    musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in\n    timed-relation with a moving image (\"synching\") will be considered a\n    Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.\n    \"Licensor\" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the\n    terms of this License.\n    \"Original Author\" means the individual or entity who created the Work.\n    \"Work\" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of\n    this License.\n    \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who\n    has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the\n    Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise\n    rights under this License despite a previous violation.\n\n2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or\nrestrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on\nthe exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other\napplicable laws.\n\n3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor\nhereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the\nduration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work\nas stated below:\n\n    to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective\n    Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;\n    to create and reproduce Derivative Works;\n    to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly,\n    and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work\n    including as incorporated in Collective Works;\n    to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly,\n    and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative\n    Works.\n\n    For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:\n        Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the\n        exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance\n        rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public\n        performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.\n        Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive\n        right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or\n        designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord\n        You create from the Work (\"cover version\") and distribute, subject to\n        the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright\n        Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).\n    Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n    the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to\n    collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g.\n    SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast)\n    of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114\n    of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).\n\nThe above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or\nhereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications\nas are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.\nAll rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n\n4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject\nto and limited by the following restrictions:\n\n    You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly\n    digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You\n    must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License\n    with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display,\n    publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose\n    any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or\n    the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not\n    sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this\n    License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute,\n    publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work\n    with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a\n    manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above\n    applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not\n    require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to\n    the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from\n    any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective\n    Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested. If You create a\n    Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent\n    practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by\n    clause 4(b), as requested.\n    If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally\n    perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep\n    intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the\n    medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or\n    pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author\n    and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor\n    institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution in Licensor's\n    copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of\n    such party or parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent\n    reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that\n    Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not\n    refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in\n    the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in\n    the Derivative Work (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original\n    Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). Such\n    credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that\n    in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such\n    credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and\n    in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship\n    credit.\n\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS\nTHE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING\nTHE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT\nLIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,\nOR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME\nJURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH\nEXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN\nNO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,\nINCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS\nLICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. Termination\n\n    This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically\n    upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities\n    who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this\n    License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such\n    individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.\n    Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\n    Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is\n    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).\n    Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work\n    under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;\n    provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this\n    License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted\n    under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full\n    force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n\n8. Miscellaneous\n\n    Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a\n    Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work\n    on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this\n    License.\n    Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work,\n    Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same\n    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n    If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under\n    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the\n    remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the\n    parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum\n    extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n    No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach\n    consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by\n    the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n    This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with\n    respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements\n    or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor\n    shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any\n    communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual\n    written agreement of the Licensor and You.",

Application of Additional Terms.\n      You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source\n      Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License\n      or the recipients. rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to\n      charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to\n      one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on\n      Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any\n      Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,\n      support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and\n      You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor\n      for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as\n      a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n      3.5.

In such a case, You must make sure the requirements\n      of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.\n\n4. Versions of the License.\n\n      4.1. New Versions.\n      Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish\n      revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each\n      version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided\n      in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to\n      modify this License.\n\n      4.2. Effect of New Versions.\n      You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered\n      Software available under the terms of the version of the License under\n      which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial\n      Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from\n      being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version\n      of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software\n      available under the terms of the version of the License under which You\n      originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose\n      to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under\n      the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the\n      license steward.\n\n      4.3. Modified Versions.\n      When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for\n      Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this\n      License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the\n      name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from\n      this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains\n      terms which differ from this License.\n\n5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\n   COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN .AS IS. BASIS, WITHOUT\n   WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT\n   LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,\n   MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK\n   AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD\n   ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL\n   DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY\n   SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN\n   ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED\n   HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n6. TERMINATION.\n\n      6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n      automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure\n      such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions\n      which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of\n      this License shall survive.\n\n      6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory\n      judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial\n      Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to\n      as .Participant.) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the\n      Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original\n      Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or\n      indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly\n      or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the\n      Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under\n      Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from\n      Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of\n      such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You\n      withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such\n      Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with\n      Participant.\n\n      6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end\n      user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor\n      hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any\n      distributor) shall survive termination.\n\n7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING\n   NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY\n   OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF\n   ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,\n   INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT\n   LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE,\n   COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR\n   LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\n   SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR\n   DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY.S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT\n   APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\n   EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS\n   EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\n   The Covered Software is a .commercial item,. as that term is defined in 48\n   C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of .commercial computer software. (as\n   that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. ? 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and .commercial\n   computer software documentation. as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212\n   (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1\n   through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered\n   Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights\n   clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or\n   provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this\n   License.\n\n9. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n   This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter\n   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such\n   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it\n   enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction\n   specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the\n   extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such\n   jurisdiction.s conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this\n   License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the\n   jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original\n   Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without\n   limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys. fees and expenses. The\n   application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the\n   International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation\n   which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the\n   drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are\n   responsible for compliance with the United States export administration\n   regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other\n   countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered\n   Software.\n\n10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n\n   As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible\n   for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its\n   utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial\n   Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable\n   basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any\n   admission of liability.\n\n   NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION\n   LICENSE (CDDL)\n\n   The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the State\n   of California (excluding conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating\n   to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of\n   the Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of\n   California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.\n\n\nThe GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991\n\n\nCopyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 Temple Place, Suite\n330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license\ndocument, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share\nand change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to\nguarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the\nsoftware is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most\nof the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose\nauthors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is\ncovered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our\nGeneral Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to\ndistribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),\nthat you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change\nthe software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can\ndo these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny\nyou these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions\ntranslate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the\nsoftware, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a\nfee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make\nsure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them\nthese terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer\nyou this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or\nmodify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that\neveryone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the\nsoftware is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to\nknow that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by\nothers will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish\nto avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually\nobtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent\nthis, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free\nuse or not licensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\nfollow.\n\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice\nplaced by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or\nwork, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any\nderivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the\nProgram or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or\ntranslated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without\nlimitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by\nthis License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not\nrestricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents\nconstitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by\nrunning the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as\nyou receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately\npublish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;\nkeep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at\nyour option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus\nforming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications\nor work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of\nthese conditions:\n\n   a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that\n   you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n   b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or\n   in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be\n   licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this\n   License.\n\n   c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,\n   you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most\n   ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate\n   copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that\n   you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n   these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.\n   (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print\n   such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print\n   an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable\nsections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably\nconsidered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and\nits terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate\nworks. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a\nwork based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole,\nand thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your\nrights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the\nright to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the\nProgram.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the\nProgram (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or\ndistribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this\nLicense.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section\n2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above\nprovided that you also do one of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,\n   which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\n   medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n   b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give\n   any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing\n   source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding\n   source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\n   medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n   c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\n   distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for\n   noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object\n   code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b\n   above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\nmodifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the\nsource code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface\ndefinition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation\nof the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed\nneed not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or\nbinary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself\naccompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code\nfrom the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third\nparties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as\nexpressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,\nsublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate\nyour rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or\nrights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so\nlong as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.\nHowever, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program\nor its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not\naccept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any\nwork based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do\nso, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the\nProgram or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),\nthe recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to\ncopy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the\nrights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third\nparties to this License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement\nor for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed\non you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the\nconditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this\nLicense. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your\nobligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a\nconsequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those\nwho receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you\ncould satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from\ndistribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the\nsection as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or\nother property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this\nsection has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software\ndistribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many\npeople have made generous contributions to the wide range of software\ndistributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to\ndistribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that\nchoice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a\nconsequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain\ncountries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright\nholder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit\ngeographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that\ndistribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such\ncase, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this\nLicense.\n\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the\nGeneral Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in\nspirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems\nor concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies\na version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\",\nyou have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version\nor of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the\nProgram does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any\nversion ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs\nwhose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for\npermission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,\nwrite to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.\nOur decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of\nall derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of\nsoftware generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE\nPROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED\nIN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS\nIS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT\nNOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A\nPARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nPROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL\nANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE\nPROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,\nSPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY\nTO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF\nTHE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER\nPARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use\nto the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which\neveryone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach\nthem to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion\nof warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a\npointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n   One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.\n\n   Copyright (C)\n\n   This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under\n   the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software\n   Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later\n   version.\n\n   This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT\n   ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS\n   FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more\n   details.\n\n   You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with\n   this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple\n   Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it\nstarts in an interactive mode:\n\n   Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n   Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n   This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain\n   conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be\ncalled something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. Here is\na sample; alter the names:\n\n   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n   `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n   signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989\n   Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.

Application of Additional Terms.\n      You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source\n      Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License\n      or the recipients. rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to\n      charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to\n      one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on\n      Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any\n      Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,\n      support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and\n      You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor\n      for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as\n      a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n      3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n      You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the\n      terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice,\n      which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are\n      in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the\n      Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient.s rights\n      in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If You\n      distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different\n      license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ\n      from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer\n      or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and\n      every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or\n      such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\n\n      3.6. Larger Works.\n      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code\n      not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work\n      as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements\n      of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.\n\n4. Versions of the License.\n\n      4.1. New Versions.\n      Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish\n      revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each\n      version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided\n      in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to\n      modify this License.\n\n      4.2. Effect of New Versions.\n      You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered\n      Software available under the terms of the version of the License under\n      which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial\n      Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from\n      being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version\n      of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software\n      available under the terms of the version of the License under which You\n      originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose\n      to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under\n      the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the\n      license steward.\n\n      4.3. Modified Versions.\n      When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for\n      Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this\n      License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the\n      name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from\n      this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains\n      terms which differ from this License.\n\n5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\n   COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN .AS IS. BASIS, WITHOUT\n   WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT\n   LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,\n   MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK\n   AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD\n   ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL\n   DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY\n   SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN\n   ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED\n   HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n6. TERMINATION.\n\n      6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n      automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure\n      such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions\n      which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of\n      this License shall survive.\n\n      6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory\n      judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial\n      Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to\n      as .Participant.) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the\n      Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original\n      Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or\n      indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly\n      or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the\n      Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under\n      Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from\n      Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of\n      such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You\n      withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such\n      Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with\n      Participant.\n\n      6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end\n      user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor\n      hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any\n      distributor) shall survive termination.\n\n7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING\n   NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY\n   OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF\n   ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,\n   INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT\n   LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE,\n   COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR\n   LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\n   SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR\n   DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY.S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT\n   APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\n   EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS\n   EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\n   The Covered Software is a .commercial item,. as that term is defined in 48\n   C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of .commercial computer software. (as\n   that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. ? 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and .commercial\n   computer software documentation. as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212\n   (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1\n   through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered\n   Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights\n   clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or\n   provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this\n   License.\n\n9. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n   This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter\n   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such\n   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it\n   enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction\n   specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the\n   extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such\n   jurisdiction.s conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this\n   License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the\n   jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original\n   Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without\n   limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys. fees and expenses. The\n   application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the\n   International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation\n   which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the\n   drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are\n   responsible for compliance with the United States export administration\n   regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other\n   countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered\n   Software.\n\n10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n\n   As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible\n   for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its\n   utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial\n   Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable\n   basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any\n   admission of liability.\n\n   NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION\n   LICENSE (CDDL)\n\n   The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the State\n   of California (excluding conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating\n   to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of\n   the Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of\n   California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.\n\n\nThe GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991\n\n\nCopyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 Temple Place, Suite\n330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license\ndocument, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share\nand change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to\nguarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the\nsoftware is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most\nof the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose\nauthors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is\ncovered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our\nGeneral Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to\ndistribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),\nthat you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change\nthe software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can\ndo these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny\nyou these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions\ntranslate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the\nsoftware, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a\nfee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make\nsure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them\nthese terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer\nyou this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or\nmodify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that\neveryone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the\nsoftware is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to\nknow that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by\nothers will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish\nto avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually\nobtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent\nthis, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free\nuse or not licensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\nfollow.\n\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice\nplaced by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or\nwork, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any\nderivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the\nProgram or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or\ntranslated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without\nlimitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by\nthis License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not\nrestricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents\nconstitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by\nrunning the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as\nyou receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately\npublish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;\nkeep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at\nyour option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus\nforming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications\nor work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of\nthese conditions:\n\n   a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that\n   you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n   b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or\n   in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be\n   licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this\n   License.\n\n   c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,\n   you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most\n   ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate\n   copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that\n   you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n   these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.\n   (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print\n   such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print\n   an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable\nsections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably\nconsidered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and\nits terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate\nworks. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a\nwork based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole,\nand thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your\nrights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the\nright to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the\nProgram.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the\nProgram (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or\ndistribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this\nLicense.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section\n2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above\nprovided that you also do one of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,\n   which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\n   medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n   b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give\n   any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing\n   source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding\n   source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\n   medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n   c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\n   distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for\n   noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object\n   code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b\n   above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\nmodifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the\nsource code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface\ndefinition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation\nof the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed\nneed not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or\nbinary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself\naccompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code\nfrom the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third\nparties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as\nexpressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,\nsublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate\nyour rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or\nrights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so\nlong as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.\nHowever, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program\nor its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not\naccept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any\nwork based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do\nso, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the\nProgram or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),\nthe recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to\ncopy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the\nrights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third\nparties to this License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement\nor for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed\non you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the\nconditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this\nLicense. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your\nobligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a\nconsequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those\nwho receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you\ncould satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from\ndistribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the\nsection as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or\nother property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this\nsection has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software\ndistribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many\npeople have made generous contributions to the wide range of software\ndistributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to\ndistribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that\nchoice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a\nconsequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain\ncountries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright\nholder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit\ngeographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that\ndistribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such\ncase, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this\nLicense.\n\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the\nGeneral Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in\nspirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems\nor concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies\na version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\",\nyou have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version\nor of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the\nProgram does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any\nversion ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs\nwhose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for\npermission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,\nwrite to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.\nOur decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of\nall derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of\nsoftware generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE\nPROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED\nIN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS\nIS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT\nNOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A\nPARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nPROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL\nANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE\nPROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,\nSPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY\nTO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF\nTHE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER\nPARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use\nto the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which\neveryone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach\nthem to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion\nof warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a\npointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n   One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.\n\n   Copyright (C)\n\n   This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under\n   the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software\n   Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later\n   version.\n\n   This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT\n   ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS\n   FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more\n   details.\n\n   You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with\n   this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple\n   Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it\nstarts in an interactive mode:\n\n   Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n   Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n   This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain\n   conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be\ncalled something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. Here is\na sample; alter the names:\n\n   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n   `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n   signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989\n   Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider\nit more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If\nthis is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead\nof this License.\n\n\n\"CLASSPATH\" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL VERSION 2\n\nCertain source files distributed by Sun Microsystems, Inc. are subject to the\nfollowing clarification and special exception to the GPL Version 2, but only\nwhere Sun has expressly included in the particular source file's header the\nwords\n\n\"Sun designates this particular file as subject to the \"Classpath\" exception as\nprovided by Sun in the License file that accompanied this code.\"\n\nLinking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making a\ncombined work based on this library. Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU\nGeneral Public License Version 2 cover the whole combination.\n\nAs a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you\npermission to link this library with independent modules to produce an\nexecutable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and to\ncopy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your choice,\nprovided that you also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and\nconditions of the license of that module.? An independent module is a module\nwhich is not derived from or based on this library.?

You may choose to offer, and to\n      charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to\n      one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on\n      Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any\n      Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,\n      support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and\n      You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor\n      for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as\n      a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n      3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n      You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the\n      terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice,\n      which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are\n      in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the\n      Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient.s rights\n      in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If You\n      distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different\n      license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ\n      from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer\n      or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and\n      every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or\n      such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\n\n      3.6. Larger Works.\n      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code\n      not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work\n      as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements\n      of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.\n\n4. Versions of the License.\n\n      4.1. New Versions.\n      Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish\n      revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each\n      version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided\n      in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to\n      modify this License.\n\n      4.2. Effect of New Versions.\n      You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered\n      Software available under the terms of the version of the License under\n      which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial\n      Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from\n      being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version\n      of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software\n      available under the terms of the version of the License under which You\n      originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose\n      to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under\n      the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the\n      license steward.\n\n      4.3. Modified Versions.\n      When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for\n      Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this\n      License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the\n      name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from\n      this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains\n      terms which differ from this License.\n\n5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\n   COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN .AS IS. BASIS, WITHOUT\n   WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT\n   LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,\n   MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK\n   AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD\n   ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL\n   DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY\n   SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN\n   ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED\n   HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n6. TERMINATION.\n\n      6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n      automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure\n      such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions\n      which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of\n      this License shall survive.\n\n      6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory\n      judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial\n      Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to\n      as .Participant.) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the\n      Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original\n      Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or\n      indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly\n      or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the\n      Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under\n      Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from\n      Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of\n      such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You\n      withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such\n      Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with\n      Participant.\n\n      6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end\n      user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor\n      hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any\n      distributor) shall survive termination.\n\n7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING\n   NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY\n   OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF\n   ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,\n   INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT\n   LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE,\n   COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR\n   LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\n   SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR\n   DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY.S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT\n   APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\n   EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS\n   EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\n   The Covered Software is a .commercial item,. as that term is defined in 48\n   C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of .commercial computer software. (as\n   that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. ? 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and .commercial\n   computer software documentation. as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212\n   (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1\n   through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered\n   Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights\n   clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or\n   provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this\n   License.\n\n9. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n   This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter\n   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such\n   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it\n   enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction\n   specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the\n   extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such\n   jurisdiction.s conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this\n   License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the\n   jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original\n   Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without\n   limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys. fees and expenses. The\n   application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the\n   International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation\n   which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the\n   drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are\n   responsible for compliance with the United States export administration\n   regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other\n   countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered\n   Software.\n\n10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n\n   As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible\n   for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its\n   utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial\n   Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable\n   basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any\n   admission of liability.\n\n   NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION\n   LICENSE (CDDL)\n\n   The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the State\n   of California (excluding conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating\n   to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of\n   the Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of\n   California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.\n\n\nThe GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991\n\n\nCopyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 Temple Place, Suite\n330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license\ndocument, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share\nand change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to\nguarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the\nsoftware is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most\nof the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose\nauthors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is\ncovered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our\nGeneral Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to\ndistribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),\nthat you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change\nthe software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can\ndo these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny\nyou these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions\ntranslate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the\nsoftware, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a\nfee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make\nsure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them\nthese terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer\nyou this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or\nmodify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that\neveryone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the\nsoftware is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to\nknow that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by\nothers will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish\nto avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually\nobtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent\nthis, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free\nuse or not licensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\nfollow.\n\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice\nplaced by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or\nwork, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any\nderivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the\nProgram or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or\ntranslated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without\nlimitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by\nthis License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not\nrestricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents\nconstitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by\nrunning the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as\nyou receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately\npublish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;\nkeep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at\nyour option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus\nforming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications\nor work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of\nthese conditions:\n\n   a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that\n   you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n   b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or\n   in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be\n   licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this\n   License.\n\n   c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,\n   you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most\n   ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate\n   copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that\n   you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n   these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.\n   (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print\n   such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print\n   an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable\nsections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably\nconsidered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and\nits terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate\nworks. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a\nwork based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole,\nand thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your\nrights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the\nright to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the\nProgram.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the\nProgram (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or\ndistribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this\nLicense.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section\n2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above\nprovided that you also do one of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,\n   which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\n   medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n   b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give\n   any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing\n   source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding\n   source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\n   medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n   c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\n   distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for\n   noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object\n   code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b\n   above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\nmodifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the\nsource code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface\ndefinition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation\nof the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed\nneed not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or\nbinary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself\naccompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code\nfrom the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third\nparties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as\nexpressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,\nsublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate\nyour rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or\nrights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so\nlong as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.\nHowever, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program\nor its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not\naccept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any\nwork based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do\nso, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the\nProgram or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),\nthe recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to\ncopy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the\nrights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third\nparties to this License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement\nor for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed\non you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the\nconditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this\nLicense. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your\nobligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a\nconsequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those\nwho receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you\ncould satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from\ndistribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the\nsection as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or\nother property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this\nsection has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software\ndistribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many\npeople have made generous contributions to the wide range of software\ndistributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to\ndistribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that\nchoice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a\nconsequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain\ncountries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright\nholder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit\ngeographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that\ndistribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such\ncase, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this\nLicense.\n\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the\nGeneral Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in\nspirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems\nor concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies\na version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\",\nyou have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version\nor of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the\nProgram does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any\nversion ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs\nwhose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for\npermission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,\nwrite to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.\nOur decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of\nall derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of\nsoftware generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE\nPROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED\nIN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS\nIS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT\nNOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A\nPARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nPROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL\nANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE\nPROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,\nSPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY\nTO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF\nTHE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER\nPARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use\nto the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which\neveryone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach\nthem to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion\nof warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a\npointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n   One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.\n\n   Copyright (C)\n\n   This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under\n   the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software\n   Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later\n   version.\n\n   This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT\n   ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS\n   FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more\n   details.\n\n   You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with\n   this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple\n   Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it\nstarts in an interactive mode:\n\n   Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n   Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n   This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain\n   conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be\ncalled something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. Here is\na sample; alter the names:\n\n   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n   `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n   signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989\n   Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider\nit more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If\nthis is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead\nof this License.\n\n\n\"CLASSPATH\" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL VERSION 2\n\nCertain source files distributed by Sun Microsystems, Inc. are subject to the\nfollowing clarification and special exception to the GPL Version 2, but only\nwhere Sun has expressly included in the particular source file's header the\nwords\n\n\"Sun designates this particular file as subject to the \"Classpath\" exception as\nprovided by Sun in the License file that accompanied this code.\"\n\nLinking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making a\ncombined work based on this library. Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU\nGeneral Public License Version 2 cover the whole combination.\n\nAs a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you\npermission to link this library with independent modules to produce an\nexecutable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and to\ncopy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your choice,\nprovided that you also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and\nconditions of the license of that module.? An independent module is a module\nwhich is not derived from or based on this library.? If you modify this library,\nyou may extend this exception to your version of the library, but you are not\nobligated to do so.?

SOME\nJURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR\nLIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND\nLIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\nThe Covered Software is a “commercial item,” as that term is defined in 48\nC.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of\n“commercial computer software” (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. §\n252.227-7014(a)(1)) and “commercial computer\nsoftware documentation” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).\nConsistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and\n48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End\nUsers acquire Covered Software with only\nthose rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of,\nand supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR,\nor other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer\nsoftware under this License.\n\n9. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof.\nIf any provision of this License is\nheld to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\nnecessary to make it enforceable. This\nLicense shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice\ncontained within the Original Software\n(except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding\nsuch jurisdiction's conflict-of-law\nprovisions.
